# Battleship
A game of strategy on the high sea!

## Backstory

Many of my fondest memories of strategy games come from the game of Battleship. Considering its simple mechanics and fun play I thought it a good candidate for a C project.

Following the "Question Driven Development" process this time around.

## Features

The feature list for the **MVP** would be as follows.

- [ ] AI
- [ ] LAN Multiplayer
- [ ] Local Multiplayer
- [ ] Keyboard or typing based inputs
- [ ] Easy installation process

The game is standard battleship otherwise, each player takes turns firing a single shot at each other until one of them sinks all the other's ships.
