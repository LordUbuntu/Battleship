- SHIFT + K over a symbol to see its manual
- Plan, Design, then Develop

PLAN:
- initialize data in main function (start/init)
- parse ommand line arguments
- start ncurses
- while the game loop is running
  - update graphics   (render)
  - handle user input (input)
  - update game state (update)
- end ncurses


DESIGN:
  FUNCTIONS:
  - pass pointers to structs and other data entities
  - functions of form 'int f(T in, T *out)'
  - data-oriented design, structs capture game state and types, references to data types are passed around and modified by functions they're passed to
  GRAPHICS:
  - graphics functions should have windows passed in, along with whatever data refs needed.
  GENERAL:
  - initial data structures like intial board position and the like will be initialized at compile time as global variables and macros
