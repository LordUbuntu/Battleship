NOTES:
- SHIFT + K over a symbol to see its manual
- Plan, Design, then Develop

DESIGN:
- pass pointers to structs and other data entities
- functions of form 'int f(T in, T *out)'
- data-oriented design, structs capture game state and types, references to data types are passed around and modified by functions they're passed to

TODO:
- redesign to use game loop proper (should draw and update be seperate, or should each action handle draw and update at once?)
