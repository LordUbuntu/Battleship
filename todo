What is the quickest way I can complete this project so it can be done in a single weekend? I simply need to complete the curses interface, setup basic TPC networking, optimize for space, and then be done.

todo:
- implement main loop (see plan file)
  - initialize data in main function (start/init)
  - parse ommand line arguments
  - start ncurses
  - while the game loop is running
    - update graphics   (render)
    - handle user move  (input)
    - get opponent move (input, network)
    - update game state (update, network)
  - end ncurses
- distribute
  - setup a cross-platform build toolchain (CMake?)
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/132ma0u/how_do_you_build_crossplatform_c_programs/?rdt=37606
  - setup a system to name a target for compilation that includes crosss-compilation (with a pure text alternative for non-ncurses supporting targets?)
  - create binaries for mutliple platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux, *BSD, Android, Etc)
