- Plan, Design, then Develop

DESIGN:
  FUNCTIONS:
  - pass pointers to structs and other data entities
  - functions of form 'int f(T in, T *out)'
  - data-oriented design, structs capture game state and types, references to data types are passed around and modified by functions they're passed to
  GRAPHICS:
  - graphics functions should have windows passed in, along with whatever data refs needed.
  GENERAL:
  - initial data structures like intial board position and the like will be initialized at compile time as global variables and macros

TODO:
- redesign to use game loop proper (should draw and update be seperate, or should each action handle draw and update at once?)
